# Notion_Calendar_API

My school calendar items are retrieved from my own server, added to my Google calendar, and the pages are added to my Notion database.

1. Register to the Google Calendar API ([Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/nodejs))
2. Follow the setup of the Notion API ([Notion Repository](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js))

Let's merge both of them !
